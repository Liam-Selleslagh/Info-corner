#### Funny story
When I was small (around 7 years old) our class went on a field trip to a construction side.
We got a few challenges over there and 1 of em was to pick up a brick and carry them over towards a wheelbarrow and dump it in there. 
My turn rolled around and I did like told I picked up a brick waggled over to the wheelbarrow and dumped it in there but the wheelbarrow tipped over forward and the brick got slingshot out hitting my eyebrow.
This happened around 13 years ago and now that I think of it, it's actually pretty funny knowing that brick wasn't in the mood of being put in a wheelbarrow.
###### TL:DR Brick doesn't like being moved and slingshots toward me as payback.
